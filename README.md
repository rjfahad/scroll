## The Problem

AI chat interfaces weren't designed for knowledge work. When you're deep in a long conversation with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, finding that brilliant response from 20 minutes ago means scrolling... and scrolling... and hoping you remember where it was.

## The Solution

Scroll adds a floating navigation panel to AI chat interfaces. Jump to any prompt or response instantly. Navigate by headings. Never lose your place again.

## Features

- **One-Click Navigation** - Jump to any turn in the conversation instantly
- **Heading Navigation** - Navigate long AI responses by their headings
- **Adaptive UI** - Seamlessly matches each platform's design language
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Navigate without touching your mouse
- **Search & Filter** - Find specific conversations or responses
- **Progress Tracking** - Always know where you are in long threads
- **View Modes** - Toggle between all messages or prompts only
- **Universal** - Works on ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini (so far)

## Built With

- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

## Why Open Source?

I believe AI tools should work better for serious work. Open sourcing Scroll means:

- **Transparency** - You can see exactly what the extension does
- **Community** - Faster iteration with feedback and contributions
- **Trust** - No black boxes, no data collection
- **Learning** - Others can learn from and build on these ideas

## Browser Support

- ⏳ Edge (needs testing)
- ⏳ Brave (needs testing)
- ⏳ Firefox (coming soon)
- ⏳ Safari (investigating)

## Acknowledgments

Built with frustration (from scrolling) and curiosity (about better UX for AI tools).

Inspired by everyone who's ever lost a great AI response in a long conversation.
